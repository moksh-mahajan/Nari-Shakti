We know that Bhamashah Yojana is meant for empowering the women of Rajasthan.But, from the data available on 
http://bhamashah.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/bhamashah/en/home.html we can clearly see that the total number of families enrolled is 
very high but the number of beneficiaries under different sections is very low. We believe that this is due to the lack of 
awareness and illiteracy in the rural parts; which is a common problem all over the country. 
The Bhamashah Yojana is exclusively for empowering women and for their financial inclusion.

We want to improve this Yojana by increasing its reach and accessibility. 

We have decided to propose an Android Application which will provide: 

•	Information to women regarding safety, health, sanitation, rights and other basic requirements. 

•	Providing various resources to help women get literate. We will be adding YouTube videos containing various tutorials like 
  the Hindi-Varnamala and basic Maths (like addition and subtraction), etc. 
  
•	Providing a feature to organize/join a camp in the villages where the common problems can be discussed on a regular basis and 
  solutions to those problems can be proposed. In this way people will become more aware and there will be an increased participation 
  in the government related schemes. 
  
• Furthermore we are proposing to provide trade related features for small scale industries of Rajasthan.If we refer to the data provided 
  on the website http://bhamashah.rajasthan.gov.in/content/raj/bhamashah/en/e-transaction.html we can see that there are 
  only 904 transactions so far in the Desi Ghee for Pregnant Women Scheme. This may be due to the unavailability of the required products. 
  If we allow women to sell their products (one to one) via this application then we will help them generate some revenue and help the
  needy by providing them the required products. This feature will help us to increase the impact of the Bhamashah Yojana many times as
  women will start earning money by selling their products. 
  
  •	Lastly we will provide the facility for direct access to various sections for the Bhamashah Enrollment.

All the above mentioned features in the application will help women get literate and more resourceful, eventually leading to a better 
society.
